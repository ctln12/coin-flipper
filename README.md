# Coin Flipper

### Description

This project aims to practice working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React and to gain more experience setting state and binding event handlers.

The goal is to create a Coin Flipper application that flips a coin when clicking and keeps track of the number of flips and the number of heads and tails.

It displays an interface that looks like this:
